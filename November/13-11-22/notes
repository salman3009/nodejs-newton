Database:
//It is an information store permanentely inside the hard disk.
//It play very important role for entire application 
//All over data is store here 
//Backend will fetch the data from database after authentication and authorization process.
//They will store huge data and it will store for each individual customer or group of data.
//Database has multiple approach but for full stack application we will focus on two approach:
      //1.SQL - structure query language - (relations) - Oracle-postgress-microsoftsqlserver
      //2.NOSQL - No structure query language - (no relation) - Mongodb-couchdb
 
//ACID
//Atomicity - each transaction inside the table should complete entire process otherwise data
//should be rollback.
//Consistency - all table will have consistency of data.
//Isolation - mulitple transaction will happen concurrenly but separately
//Durability - data will be available even it is software or hardware failure
